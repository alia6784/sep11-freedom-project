## context

This year, Iâ€™m starting a new freedom project using JavaScript to make a shooter game. I want the game to be fun but also be challenging a bit just to make it more interesting. After exploring different tools, I decided to use impact.JS as my main game engine and Kaboom as a backup. I hope this year i can make a fun game for everyone to play including me that is playable and exciting.

## Why impactjs

I chose Impact.js as my tool because it lets me create many different types of levels, which I think makes the game more fun. I believe Impact.js is the right choice because I can build levels that change like different shooting difficultly every level. I could even make something like the base game that impact shows on there website with multiple levels.


## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

 we just started on the Freedom project, I am on the first stage of the Engineering Design Process which is how can I solve a problem. At the start i did not know how to actually tinker with my tool or how to pick my tool.I also had a promblem with thinking on how I am going to make the game I want but I have kindof visualize on how I want to do it.


## Skills

some skills im am starting to build is communication and how to google for information that help me understand my project. I am aslo a learing on how to ask for help throught my friends and my teacher.And when we hit a problem, I sometimes ask my friends for help to fix it or look online for answers, trying to learn from my mistakes along the way.

 ## summary

 As of now, I am committed to making a shooter game using the game engine Impact.js, hoping it will be very successful. I am confident in using Impact.js to create a fun and engaging game and hope that as I consistently work on this project, my skills will continue to grow.
