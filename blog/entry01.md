## context

This year, Iâ€™m starting a new freedom project using JavaScript to make a shooter game. I want the game to be fun but also be challenging a bit just to make it more interesting. After exploring different tools, I decided to use impact.JS as my main game engine and Kaboom as a backup. I hope this year i can make a fun game for everyone to play including me that is playable and exciting.

## Why impactjs

I chose Impact.js as my tool because it lets me create many different types of levels, which I think makes the game more fun. I believe Impact.js is the right choice because I can build levels that change like different shooting difficultly every level. I could even make something like the base game that impact shows on there website with multiple levels.
